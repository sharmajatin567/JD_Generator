Education- UG: B.Sc - Computers PG:Any Postgraduate Doctorate:Doctorate Not Required Company Profile: IYUNO Media Group IYUNO is one of world's leading media localization and access service company. While the key of IYUNO's business is to support the language subtitling, dubbing and captioning of key global media companies, IYUNO is growing at more than 100 every year with strong competence in combining innovative technology development to its services to outcompete its competitors. The TV industry is facing a major change such as the one we've seen in the phone industry a few years ago when smartphones first came out. People are no longer watching linear TV but rapidly moving over to a mobile, on-demand based platform where the variety of contents are much wider than ever before - hence the media localization market has been demanding unbearable volume of work in the past few years. In such a fast changing environment, the traditional subtitling companies that use offline subtitling S/Ws to do work and merely relying on human efforts to control quality have been losing their positions and innovative companies like IYUNO have been rising within the industry. IYUNO's cloud based subtitle editor embeds hundreds of different automatic quality control parameters that often happen during human subtitling and ensures quality outputs for massive volumes of subtitling work demanded by many new Internet based media platforms arising these days. It's collaborative fast turnaround platform combines hundreds of resources to a single project simultaneously over the Internet to enable world's fastest full quality subtitle turnaround at 4 hours or less. IYUNO's new deep learning approach for quality control is enabling an preemptive quality control approach rather than adding an automatic QC parameter after an incident has occurred. IYUNO's world's first professional subtitle marketplace complements our core premium services and enables other vendors around the world to meet with clients that are demanding services that IYUNO is not capable of undertaking but at the same time utilizing IYUNO's strong technology and experience to ensure quality and efficient output. IYUNO believes that media localization is now transforming from a labor-intensive 1.0 industry into a technology-intensive 2.0. We are converting ourselves into a core engineering company where technology efficiency and control can enhance the massive volume this market is demanding. IYUNO seeks to offer an end-to-end media service solution where clients can rely on IYUNO's technologies to be able to ensure a quality and safe delivery into all kinds of media platforms based on various countries in the world, with the right transcode profiles and technically compliant subtitles to service global audience. IYUNO seeks to start this approach by building a core RD center in Bangalore, India where our CTO will base himself to involve in the hire of highly competitive software engineers and carrying out various engineering projects that will help the company move towards our goal. Also the resources hired will clearly be positioned to move on to more senior roles to travel to IYUNO's global offices currently located in 11 countries (and expanding) to involve in on-site projects.
